# Clicker

I created this project purely for fun and personal enjoyment, driven not only by my passion for programming but also by a desire to craft a Clicker game/template that offers easy customization according to your preferences. My aim is to deliver a clicker experience far superior to the lifeless ones typically encountered on platforms like Google Play, plagued by excessive advertisements that swiftly diminish the joy of play. Additionally, I seek to rectify the simplistic designs that often leave players feeling as though they're not progressing through the game.

Currently, the project features the most basic design for a Clicker, consisting of two buttons for upgrades and a simple click animation. However, it remains a work in progress, with further developments underway.
